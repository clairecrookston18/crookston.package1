*Goal:* Work on plotting head length and width and cleaning up/organizing data.

*Worked:*

*Did not work:*
```{r}
#Created pipe to make new object containing only specimen, population, HdLngth and HdWdth columsn of "measurements".

HdL_x_HdW <- measurements %>% 
select(specimen, population, HdLngth, HdWdth) %>% 
group_by(specimen)
HdL_x_HdW
```

```{r}
#Wanted to determine if any of the specimen numbers were not unique (replicated) 
unique(HdL_x_HdW$specimen)
#looks like there are 425 unique specimen IDs, but using
str(HdL_x_HdW)
#There are 437 total entries of specimen so come must be repeated.
```

```{r}
#How do I get rid of the repeated specimen values? 
```
