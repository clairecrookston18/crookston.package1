##Questions

1. Which habitats have the largest number of species?
  
  Florida.Bottomland.Hardwood.Forest
  Florida.Upland.Hardwood.Forest
  Florida.Upland.Pine.Sandhill
  
  
2. What do you notice about the differences between the Shannon (q=1) & 
  Simpsonâ€™s (1=2) Diversity indices? Is their relationship (e.g., distance 
  between them) consistent across sites?
  
  The statistics are pretty much the same. I noticed that the "order" listed 
  under the sites is 1 for the Shannons DI and 2 for the Simpsons.
  The Shannon observed/estimator/LCL/UCL colummns are almost always half the
  value of the simpsons statistic.
  
  The plots look very similar.

  
3. Are abundance, richness, and diversity closely related to each other in 
  these systems? Are habitats with the highest abundances the most diverse? 
  Why or why not?
  
  abundance seems to correlate with richness (sort of) and not at all to 
  diversity.
  
4. Are these habitats spread out or clustered together? Do you think this has 
  any impact on the diversity measures?
